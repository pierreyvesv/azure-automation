## VM Sizing

Sizing your VM is crucial to avoid over spending. It's crucial that you start by understanding the naming convention used by Azure.

Read <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/vm-naming-conventions>

One or more lower case letters denote additive features, such as:
a = AMD-based processor
d = disk (local temp disk is present); this is for newer Azure VMs, see Ddv4 and Ddsv4-series
h = hibernation capable
i = isolated size
l = low memory; a lower amount of memory than the memory intensive size
m = memory intensive; the most amount of memory in a particular size
t = tiny memory; the smallest amount of memory in a particular size
r = RDMA capable
s = Premium Storage capable, including possible use of Ultra SSD (Note: some newer sizes without the attribute of s can still support Premium Storage e.g. M128, M64, etc.)
